Check Text ( C-21060r305333_chk )
Verify that kernel core dumps are disabled unless needed.

Check if "kdump" service is active with the following command:

# systemctl is-active kdump.service
inactive

If the "kdump" service is active, ask the System Administrator if the use of the service is required and documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

If the service is active and is not documented, this is a finding.
