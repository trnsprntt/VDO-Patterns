Description
Configuring the Ubuntu operating system to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.

Check Text ( C-20890r304823_chk )
Verify users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that "pam_lastlog" is used and not silent with the following command:

# grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/login

session required pam_lastlog.so showfailed

If "pam_lastlog" is missing from "/etc/pam.d/login" file, is not "required", or the "silent" option is present, this is a finding.
Fix Text (F-20889r304824_fix)
Configure the Ubuntu operating system to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred by setting the required configuration options in "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac".

Add the following line to the top of "/etc/pam.d/login":

session required pam_lastlog.so showfailed
